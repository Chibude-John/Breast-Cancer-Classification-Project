# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Project
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify breast cancer images as benign or malignant. It involves data preprocessing, model training with CNN layers, and evaluation using accuracy. The model predicts cancer types based on microscopic images, assisting in early detection.
